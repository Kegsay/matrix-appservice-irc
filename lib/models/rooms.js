 * A room ID specifies a Matrix room uniquely.

 * A "Room" is a combination of a unique Matrix room and a unique IRC room.
 * A Matrix room can have many Rooms (bridged to many irc channels).
 * An IRC channel can have many Rooms (bridged to many Matrix rooms).
 * Some of these bridges can be hard-coded by the launch configuration.
 * Some of these bridges are dynamically generated if:
 *  - A Matrix user invites a Virtual IRC User to a room (PM)
 *  - A Matrix user tries to join a room alias which maps to an IRC channel.
